Art created using matlab code 

I have always been fascinated by art created with code. 
When I learn't how equations can draw interesting curves, I was totally in love with the subject of "curve tracing" - cardiode was amongst the one that took my heart. 

Kept experimenting for years, making simple shapes using codes and clubbing them together. 
I'm happy to share with you this repository where I put together few matlab codes that bring some pictures to life. 

Most of the creations here are my own, Few other are inspired by https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/communitycontests/contests/4/entries - and tweaked to make them catch your eye. 

To all the newfound artists out there- Cheers \m/
